Let's get started!

## Step 5: View Your Screen in a Web Browser

Now that your screen is set up and has a playlist assigned, you can view it in any web browser. Each screen has a unique, public URL that you can open on any device.

1.  **Navigate to the Screens Page:** Go to the **"Screens"** page.
2.  **Get the Screen Key:** Find your screen and click the **"🔑 Key"** button. This will reveal the unique device key for your screen.
3.  **Copy the Viewer URL:** Copy the provided viewer URL. It will look something like this: `https://dsp.my-toolbox.info/viewer.php?key=YOUR_DEVICE_KEY`
4.  **Open in a New Tab:** Open a new browser tab and paste the URL. Your playlist will begin playing in the browser.
